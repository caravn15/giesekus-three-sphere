Code to produce the figures in the paper "A computational approach to simulating a three-sphere swimmer in a viscoelastic fluid modelled via the Giesekus constitutive law" by C. V. Neal and R. N. Bearon.

##### IMPORTANT #####
The data file 'All_Sims_Loaded_Data.mat' is too large to upload to Github. Running any figure script that requires this file will automatically trigger all simulations to be run to produce 'All_Sims_Loaded_Data.mat'. However, this will take a very long time. It is therefore suggested that you instead download this data from this Dropbox link (within the data folder): https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sikk3y0dgjilluyd5nbqq/AJj8_bW4CshsQPrncym58Jo?rlkey=o9xqmvnccfxsmc5lvxyev5rnc&st=wy0e3ylf&dl=0
